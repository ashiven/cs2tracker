# CSGO-Tracker
A simple tool to track the market price of specific CSGO items.

How To Use 

1) Download the source code under 'Releases' and extract it somewhere on your hard drive ( For example C:\CSGOTracker ).
2) Create a shortcut for csgotracker.exe and save it on your desktop or wherever you like.
3) Run the program.


Options

- Click the 'Edit Config' button to change the amount of specific items you own and then save the config file.
- Click the 'Run!' button to gather the current market prices of your items and automatically calculate the total amount in USD and EUR.
- Click the 'Show History' button for a price chart consisting of past calculations. A new data point for this chart is generated once a day upon running the program. 
- In case you want to edit or remove entries from the history just edit the output.csv file.
- If you want to avoid being temporarily IP blocked for making too many requests in short succession, you can register for an API Key on crawlbase.com and enter it into the API_Key field at the end of the config file. This will route every request through a different proxy server and prevent IP blocks.
